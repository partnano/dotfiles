THESE FILES ARE NOT IN THEIR CORRECT PATHING, THESE ARE MARLY THROWN TOGETHER FOR BACKUP PURPOSES !

### i3/
- 'config' is the base config of i3wm (Airblades version)
- 'i3lock.py' is the used lock file
- 'i3lock.sh' is the base blur version
- 'scripts/' is the scripts folder for i3blocks

### i3blocks.conf
- The i3blocks config. Separators feel a bit hacky. The "center alignment" with empty spaces is god awful.

### dunstrc
- The config file for dunst. (You can actually do more with this thing, than I expected, awesome)
